# What is Immediate-mode-renderer (IMR)?
IMR is a webgl renderer for 2d inspired by imgui.
IMR does not require a specific data structure to draw an object.
Just pass the data needed for drawing to the api.

If you are familiar with scene graphs, you can wrap IMR by creating your own scene graph data structure.
